                    “Its not about saying the right things, its about doing the right things at the right time.” With this ideology in mind Youth Outreach programme is all set to organise a flood relief drive to assist the victims of Dharmasala Block of Jajpur District. The flood has affected the lives of around 4 lakh innocent people living in Jajpur, destroying farms, roads and the overall livelihood. This outreach programme is being funded by the events organised by Youth Odisha and the contribution of those who extended their support. The aim is to reach out to maximum number of people and provide relief in the form of food, clothes or anything that they require so that these affected people can start their lives afresh."

                Do you think it is unworthy or a waste of time for entrepreneurs to take up on some philanthropic work? Youth India Foundation is here to change your mind about that! We want to create "social entrepreneurs" who utilize technologies and innovations to solve social issues because, after all, it is the same community that we ALL live in and helping out people around us would uplift our whole community as a whole! YIF wants to create awareness among aspiring entrepreneurs that being a social entrepreneur doesn't require you to shift your focus from building a brand to absolute charity or nonprofitable work.

            "True success is not acing all your exams, working at the top notch companies, earnings millions of money but becoming a humble human who uses his power to bring smiles on the faces of the needy and one who contributes towards the making of a better society. I have always been actively participating in various activities apart from academics that taught me a great deal of skills and values that helped me achieve what I've achieved today, founding Youth India Foundation. My journey started from my school, Sai International where I got many opportunities like being the Cultural Secretary (Secondary) in the student council, being a member of the international press MUN, successfully planning and directing out school's biggest science fair SAITED working as the Finance Director and organising multiple events with mass footfall like Sai Abhinandan, MUN, Sai confluence etc - All these made it possible for me to learn to manage such a huge national team and making YIF. I thank everyone, all my dear friends and family that helped me accomplish so much and I look forward to doing more with all their love and support."
